AI-Powered Code Review Assistant
This is a Python-based command-line tool that performs code reviews using popular linters and security tools such as Pylint, Flake8, and Bandit. The tool analyzes Python files for code quality, style, performance, and security issues, and provides explanations for the detected issues.

Features
*Pylint Integration: Checks code for syntax errors, adherence to coding standards, and potential issues.
*Flake8 Integration: Checks for PEP 8 style violations and reports common issues such as line length and unused imports.
*Bandit Integration: Detects security vulnerabilities in Python code.
*Explanations for Issues: Provides human-readable explanations for common issues reported by Pylint and Flake8.
*Color-Coded Output: Uses colors in the terminal for better readability of the results.

Prerequisites
Before running this tool, make sure you have the following installed:

.Python 3.x
.Pylint
.Flake8
.Bandit
.Colorama (for color-coded output)

You can install these dependencies using pip:
pip install pylint flake8 bandit colorama

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-code-review-assistant.git
cd ai-code-review-assistant

Install the required dependencies:

pip install pylint flake8 bandit colorama

Usage
To run the code review assistant, use the following command:

python cli.py <path_to_python_file>
Example:
python cli.py my_script.py

The tool will then run the specified Python file through Pylint, Flake8, and Bandit, reporting any issues found, along with explanations.

Output Example:
Green text: No issues found.
Yellow text: Issues found, followed by explanations of the problems.

Running code review for my_script.py...

Pylint Results:
my_script.py:5:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)
Explanation: This code is missing a module-level docstring. You should describe what this module does.

Flake8 Results:
my_script.py:12:80: E501 line too long (81 > 79 characters)
Explanation: This line exceeds the maximum allowed line length. Try to keep your lines shorter for better readability.

Bandit Results:
No security issues found in my_script.py
Error Handling
If no issues are found by a tool, the tool will display a message saying: No issues found.
If the specified Python file doesn't exist or can't be analyzed, the tool will gracefully handle the error and notify the user.

Contribution
Feel free to contribute by:

*Expanding the list of explanations for Pylint and Flake8 errors.
*Adding support for more linters or static analysis tools.
*Improving the CLI experience.
